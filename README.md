# WinForm_ProductivityAlarm
A timer that helps me work more efficiently 
Using Winform and C# to create an app that helped me work more productively. 
Built with Visual Studio 2022

# How To Use
The initial build is pretty simple.
1. Press the button to start the timer.
2. The app will notify you after 25 minutes to take a 5-minute break.
3. After the break, the timer will repeat the process.
4. You can also pause the timer while it's running in case there's an interruption or so-called "unforeseen circumstances".

The purpose of this app is to build an alarm but also to make a Windows app and improve C# skill.
